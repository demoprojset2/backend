## Backend Deployment
The three AWS technologies were used for backend deployment are :
Elastic Container Service (ECS)
Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
Fargate.


### Deploying a Docker Container to ECS

<strong>The steps here are:<strong>
1. Create the Docker image
2. Create an ECR registry
3. Tag the image
4. Give the Docker CLI permission to access your Amazon account
5. Upload your docker image to ECR
6. Create a Fargate Cluster for ECS to use for the deployment of your container.
7. Create an ECS Task.
8. Run the ECS Task!

## Frontend Deployment
- Creating our react app:
>npx create-react-app frontend

- After adding different components according to functionalities.We can make
a build on our app so that it can be deployed easily.
>npm run build

- For connecting netlify directly from your terminal , we have to install
NETLIFY CLI .It will authorize us .
>npm install netlify-cli -g

- Adding a redirect file so that it will work according to our react router.
/apicall/* http://54.198.55.127:8000/:splat 200
/* /index.html 200

- Final step , deploy to netlify
>netlify deploy
>netlify deploy --prod
